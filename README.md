# Vuex Deux

*A task manager for your life*

[Live Demo](https://dengsauve.github.io/vuex-deux/)

I was recently inspired by a HN post where someone made a vanilla js clone of the app Teux Deux.

So here's a clone in Vue. 
I created this using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/),
 [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/),
 [VueDraggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable), 
 and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). 
This is the front-end portion only, which I'm going to using in Laravel

## Usage

If you follow the Live Demo link, all data will be kept in browser local storage. As is, this is a suitable todo list
provided that you don't change machines.

## Key Features

- [x] Add and delete tasks
- [x] Mark tasks as completed/incomplete
- [ ] Task rollover
- [x] Create custom task list
- [x] Rename custom task lists

## Improvements

I actually think Teux Deux is pretty perfect. However, I do have a few add ons in mind

- [x] Serverless, data will persist in browser
- [ ] I would like to be able to have notes attached to days
- [ ] I would like to be able to search everything (fuzzy matching)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run serve`

Have fun!
