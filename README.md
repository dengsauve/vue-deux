# Vuex Deux

*A task manager for your life*

I was recently inspired by a HN post where someone made a vanilla js clone of the app Teux Deux.

So here's a clone in Vue. 
I created this using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/),
 [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/),
 [VueDraggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable), 
 and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). 

This is the front-end portion only, which I'm going to using in Laravel

## Improvements

I actually think Teux Deux is pretty perfect. However, I do have a few add ons in mind

- [ ] I would like to be able to have notes attached to days
- [ ] I would like to be able to search everything (fuzzy matching)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run serve`

Have fun!
