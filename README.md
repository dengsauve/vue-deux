# Vue Deux

A task manager for your life

I was recently inspired by a HN post where someone made a vanilla js clone of the app Teux Deux.

So here's a clone in Vue.

## Improvements

I actually think Teux Deux is pretty perfect. However, I do have a few add ons in mind

- [ ] I would like to be able to have notes attached to days
- [ ] I would like to be able to search everything (fuzzy matching)

## Key Carry Overs

- [ ] Tri-part layout of menu|calendar|misc. lists top to bottom
- [ ] Unfinished or incomplete tasks roll over to the next day
